-- PART 1 - ANALYSIS (Lines 12-188): Detailed investigation of each source file
-- PART 2 - PR PROPOSALS (Lines 190-248): Consolidated pull request suggestions based on findings

-- I may have missed some properties that exist in stdlib but are located in places I didn't think of.
-- If you think properties I marked as "missing" can be present in other modules, let me know 

Properties marked ⚠️ are category-theoretic, from what I understood it's not a relevant addition to the stdlib
